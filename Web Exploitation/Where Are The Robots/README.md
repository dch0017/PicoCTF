# Where Are The Robots
Author: dch0017

## Challenge Description
Can you find the robots?

## Accessing Site
First we head over to site and see this </br>
![website](./website.png)
</br>

## Robots
Based off the name of the challenge, my first guess is to check to see if the site has a robots.txt file. After browsing over, it does and it has a URL to another page.

```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```

So we head over to the referenced URL and there in plaintext is the flag.</br>
![flag](./flag.png)
</br>

## Linux

```console
┌──(dch0017㉿linux)-[~]
└─$ curl --silent https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html | grep -o "picoCTF{.*}" --color=none
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}
```
