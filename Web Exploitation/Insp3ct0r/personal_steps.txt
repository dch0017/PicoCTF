1) Go to https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/
2) The page says Inspect Me and the challenge is "Insp3ct0r" so the flag will
probably be found using the browsers native inspect tool. (Right-click inspect in Chrome)
3) First viewing the page source, I see that their is a custom stylesheet
and a custom script, mycss.css and myjs.js respectively. Also at the bottom
of the source code part 1/3 of the flag is there. (picoCTF{tru3_d3)
4) Browsing to the custom CSS from Chrome's inspector, we find part 2/3 
at the bottom of the file (t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t).
5) Then finally browsing to the custom JS file, we find part 3/3 at the 
bottom (_lucky?832b0699})
