# Picobrowser
Author: dch0017

## Challenge Description
This website can be rendered only by picobrowser, go and catch the flag!

## Accessing Site
First we head to the site and we are greeted by this: </br>
![site](./website.png)
</br>

## Flag Button
Well this could be easy, there is a giant flag button. Let's go ahead and press it:</br>
![flag error](./flagerror.png)
</br>

Well clearly I don't have picobrowser as it's not real, but the words after ```Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/109.0.5414.75 Safari/537.36``` look like the ```User-Agent``` header in a web request.

## User-Agent
Let's pop open burp suite and navigate back to the site, intercept that initial request, and modify our ```User-Agent``` header to be ```picobrowser```.

After editing our request will look like:
```
GET /problem/26704/flag HTTP/1.1

```

## Success
After forwarding the request, we get in and there is our flag:</br>
![flag](./success.png)
</br>

We could have also done this from command line so let's look at that.

## Linux
```console
┌──(dch0017㉿linux)-[~]
└─$ curl "https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/26704/flag" -H "user-agent:picobrowser" -s | grep -o "picoCTF{.
*}" --color=none
picoCTF{p1c0_s3cr3t_ag3nt_e9b160d0}
```
