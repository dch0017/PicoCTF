1) Go to http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/ and we see a website with a "How"
and "What" buttons, dynamic webpage and clicking either button does not take
you from the initial home page.
2) Using Chrome dev tools we can see that there are 2 files, a myjs.js and
mycss.css. Also inspecting page source will give us part 1 of the flag
3) Inspecting mycss.css gives us part 2 of the flag.
4) Viewing myjs.js doesn't give us a flag but does give us a hint
"How can I keep Google from indexing my website?" This lets us know
that the next clue may be in robots.txt which disallows bots from indexing
sites
5) Go to http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/robots.txt and we see that
part 3 of the flag is there and also another hint.
"I think this is an apache server"
6) I needed some Google for that one but apache uses configuration files which 
can be accessed by default using .htaccess, so we head to http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.htaccess
7) Here we get part 4 of the flag and another hint
"I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there."
8) After some poking around this was right in my face. Macs store a .DS_Store
file anytime you view a file using Finder but it's usually invisible. So we
try heading to http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/.DS_Store and there is part 5
of our flag.
