1) Go to http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/ and are presented with a text box and Search button. Page is about cookies,
first thing I do is open the source to see if anything immediately sticks out.
2) "Snickerdoodle" is pre-emptively filled in window so type that and it takes us to http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check
with the message saying "I love snickerdoodle cookies"
3) Checking Chrome's dev tools and network tab we see when we submit the request it sends a POST request to http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/search
which in turn sets a cookie to "name=0" that cookie is then passed on to http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check as a 
GET request.
4) This gives me the idea that I can change the numerical value of the 'name' cookie and may get a different response, so
using curl I try a few commands

curl --cookie "name=1" -X GET http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check
curl --cookie "name=2" -X GET http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check
curl --cookie "name=3" -X GET http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/check

And all lead to different pages.
5) We could go through all those manually but we don't know how many there are so we can write a quick script to loop through
each different cookie and grep out any output that matches the flag form.
6) The script can be found under get_flag.sh
