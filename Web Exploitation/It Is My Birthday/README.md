# It Is My Birthday
Author: dch0017

## Challenge Description
I sent out 2 invitations to all of my friends for my birthday! I'll know if they get stolen because the two invites look similar, and they even have the same md5 hash, but they are slightly different! You wouldn't believe how long it took me to find a collision. Anyway, see if you're invited by submitting 2 PDFs to my website.

## Accessing Site
First we head over to site and see this </br>

## Sources
All I know right here is we have a choice to upload 2 files, which should have the same hash but be different and it is written in PHP. 

## Birthday Party
The name of the challenge seems to be a reference to a Birthday Attack which in simple terms, is an attack to find that a collision of hashes between two or more entities. There's math to it and probablities, but here we need to find one of these collisions. 

## Collision Files
Just searching "md5 collision files" on Google, will bring us to [this page](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/md5collision/) which conveniently has example files with a md5 hash collision.

Changing those extensions to .pdf and uploading takes us to a page showing us the PHP script and conveniently has the flag at the bottom.

```php
<?php

if (isset($_POST["submit"])) {
    $type1 = $_FILES["file1"]["type"];
    $type2 = $_FILES["file2"]["type"];
    $size1 = $_FILES["file1"]["size"];
    $size2 = $_FILES["file2"]["size"];
    $SIZE_LIMIT = 18 * 1024;

    if (($size1 < $SIZE_LIMIT) && ($size2 < $SIZE_LIMIT)) {
        if (($type1 == "application/pdf") && ($type2 == "application/pdf")) {
            $contents1 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]);
            $contents2 = file_get_contents($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"]);

            if ($contents1 != $contents2) {
                if (md5_file($_FILES["file1"]["tmp_name"]) == md5_file($_FILES["file2"]["tmp_name"])) {
                    highlight_file("index.php");
                    die();
                } else {
                    echo "MD5 hashes do not match!";
                    die();
                }
            } else {
                echo "Files are not different!";
                die();
            }
        } else {
            echo "Not a PDF!";
            die();
        }
    } else {
        echo "File too large!";
        die();
    }
}
