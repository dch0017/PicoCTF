# PicoCTF
This is where I store my thoughts and solutions as I go through various challenges at https://play.picoctf.org/practice

Solutions are sorted by category and have separate directories per specific challenge.
Each directory will have a flag_directions.txt, some directories will also contain get_flag.sh shell script.
