# PicoCTF
This is where I store my thoughts and solutions as I go through various challenges at https://play.picoctf.org/practice </br>
CTF's allow for me to gain a better understanding of different cyber security tools and their uses. And they're fun.</br></br>
Solutions are sorted by category and have separate directories per  challenge.</br>
This repository will be continually updated, and not all challenges will be completed.</br></br>
